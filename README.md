# longest-common-subsequence

A simple implementation of the LCS problem which applies dynamic programming paradigm

Programming Language: JavaScript
UI: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

How to use:
1. To open the executed program, open the "index.html" file. Input the .txt file by clicking the button. The input data will be shown under the button as well as the length of the lcs, the lcs, and execution time taken.

2. To examine the exact result, open the console by hitting the F12 button on Chrome. Select the console section. The length of lcs, lcs result, and time taken will be shown in the console as well.

3. There are two JavaScript files which contain the functions of the algorithms. The first one is "lcs.js", which executes longest common subsequence functions. The second one is "script.js" which contains the function to read the input data from .txt file and execute the algorithm.

4. To open the JavaScript files, just open with any text-editors.

Note: If you want to read different txt files, press F5 or refresh your browser first.
